      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
       Climate change and health challenges associated with poor physical fitness have escalated in recent years, prompting the introduction of initiatives to promote sustainable transportation and physical activity. 
       One such initiative is the TfL Cycle Hire scheme in London, which provides publicly accessible bicycles for rent. This study analyses data from the initiative collected in August 2023. The analysis encompasses data wrangling,
        exploratory data analysis, and hypothesis testing. Key findings reveal that peak demand occurs between 5 pm and 7 pm, most rides last less than 30 minutes, and demand on weekdays is statistically significantly
         higher than on weekends.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Air pollution is a major contributor to both public health crises and climate change. According to the WHO, policies aimed at reducing air pollution
         create a win-win situation for climate and health outcomes. The most common source of air pollution is the emission of carbon dioxide (CO₂).  (Air quality, energy and health).  
         Beyond its impact on established health endpoints, air pollution is associated with increased disease incidence and premature mortality. The devastating 1952 air pollution episode in London exemplifies its lethal consequences. 
         Today, air pollution has surpassed poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water to become the leading environmental cause of premature death. (Air pollution and public health: emerging hazards and improved understanding of risk - PMC)
      </p>

      <p>
        Strategies to reduce air pollution include transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower; 
        developing urban forests; and reducing vehicle emissions through alternative transportation options like public transit, walking, 
        and cycling. (Climate Change Impacts on Air Quality | US EPA) Cycling, in particular, offers significant environmental benefits: 
        replacing just one mile of driving with cycling can prevent approximately 300 grams of CO₂ emissions. Additionally, cycling generates 
        considerably less noise pollution than motorised vehicles. (How Does Cycling Reduce Air Pollution)
      </p>

      <p>
      Beyond environmental advantages, cycling provides substantial health benefits. Research demonstrates a statistically 
      significant reduction in mortality risk among regular cyclists. Cycling has been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease 
      and type 2 diabetes, making it an effective intervention for both individual health and public welfare.

          using insights from hourly and daily demand patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
          Urban planners can design better cycling infrastructure and improve network connectivity 
          by understanding dominant travel corridors and origin-destination pairs.
          </li>
          <li>
          Policymakers can develop evidence-based sustainable transportation policies and promotional strategies 
          informed by temporal usage trends and weekday-weekend demand differences.
          </li>
          <li>
          Researchers can advance academic knowledge of shared mobility systems through statistical validation 
          of behavioural patterns and trip type differences.
          </li>
          <li>
          Public health officials can support active transportation initiatives that reduce air pollution 
          and improve population health using data-driven evidence of cycling usage patterns.

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        The data for this study were obtained from Kaggle and comprise detailed records of 776,527 bicycle journeys from the Transport 
        for London (TfL) Cycle Hire system during August 2023. The TfL Cycle Hire initiative provides publicly accessible bicycles for 
        rent across London, promoting sustainable transportation and physical fitness. This comprehensive dataset captures individual 
        trip-level information, offering a detailed snapshot of cycling activity throughout the month. Key variables include start and 
        end station details, timestamps, bicycle identification numbers, and trip durations
      </p>

      <p> 
        The Python programming language was employed to perform all analytical functions. Core libraries such as ‘pandas’ and 
        NumPy were used for data wrangling and feature engineering, while ‘matplotlib’ and ‘seaborn’ supported visualisation. 
        Statistical testing was conducted using SciPy, ensuring reproducibility and methodological rigour throughout the workflow.
      </p>

      <p> 
        Pre-processing: The pre-processing stage involved cleaning the dataset by removing duplicates and performing feature engineering. 
        Data transformations were applied to convert data types into appropriate formats, ensuring seamless and accurate data analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Exploratory Analysis: Exploratory analysis was conducted to examine key usage patterns within the dataset. 
        This included identifying the top five origin and destination stations, determining the most popular origin-destination route, 
        analysing peak demand hours, assessing daily demand patterns, and comparing average trip durations between one-way and all-round trips.
      </p>

      <p> 
        Hypothesis testing: Statistical hypothesis tests were conducted to validate observed patterns and assess relationships within the data. 
        Tests employed included the D'Agostino-Pearson normality test to assess distribution normality, the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing 
        two independent groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test for comparing multiple groups, and the Chi-square test for examining categorical 
        associations. 
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="report-section">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The most popular origin-destination pair was the route from Hyde Park Corner, Hyde Park to Albert Gate, Hyde Park, 
        accounting for 392 trips. Hyde Park Corner emerged as the most frequented station, serving as both the leading origin and 
        destination point in the bike-sharing network.

        A temporal analysis indicated that peak activity occurred during morning and evening rush hours, 
        reflecting a mix of commuting and recreational trips. Spatial clustering also revealed areas of 
        high bike density near major parks and business centers.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        Results suggest that the London bike-sharing system experiences strong demand around tourist 
        attractions and commercial areas. Weather and time of day significantly influence ridership, 
        with sunny weekends showing the highest usage. The Hyde Park region’s prominence demonstrates 
        its importance as both a leisure and commuting zone.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This study highlights how data-driven insights can guide the optimization of bike-sharing 
        systems in large urban areas. It emphasizes the potential of integrating weather data, 
        demographic trends, and predictive analytics in future research to improve service distribution 
        and user satisfaction.
